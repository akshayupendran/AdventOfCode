tracking the four largest moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto.
position of each moon (your puzzle input).
simulate their motion so you can avoid them.
Each moon has a 3-dimensional position (x, y, and z) and a 3-dimensional velocity. The position of each moon is given in your scan; the x, y, and z velocity of each moon starts at 0.
Simulate the motion of the moons in time steps.
Within each time step, first update the velocity of every moon by applying gravity.
update the position of every moon by applying velocity.
Time progresses by one step once all of the positions are updated.
Velocity can be +1, -1 or 0
